sudoku
======

This is an old sudoku program I wrote in 2006/2007. It works but has few features.

The following files have been included with this archive.

inc_googleads.php -- can be used, i figured why not
index.php -- displays sudoku puzzles
sudoku-generator.php -- generates sudoku puzzles and stores in the database
sudoku.sql -- database structure for storing sudoku puzzles

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a mysql database on your web hosting
2. Import sudoku.sql into that database
3. Open index.php and sudoku-generator.php in notepad/Dreamweaver
4. Edit the dbconnect function near the top to have your db username/password
5. Save and upload php files to your web hosting
6. Open Index.php in a web browser and your set!
